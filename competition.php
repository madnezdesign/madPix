  <h1>Competition</h1>
  <p>There are many lightbox galleries and slideshows out on the market, both for no cost and those that cost money.<br>
    Some lightbox galleries are more advanced and can be a bit difficult to install. But there are also those that are small, simple and fast.</p>
  <p>Everything depends on what you are looking for.<br>
    If you want more effects then it will become more advanced and might be more difficult for someone on a newbie level to understand all the scripts.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold">madPix</span> is focused for those who wants a fast, small and simple lightbox and/or slideshow and for it not to involve much complex coding our products<br>
    don't have as many effects as some of the more advanced products out there.</p>
  <p>Here are a couple of lightboxes and slideshows for comparison.  </p>
  <h2><a href="http://ilightbox.net/">iLightBox</a></h2>
  <p>This lightbox supports  swipe events, Youtube and Vimeo integration for HTML5 video. Each image window has social sharing icons <br>
    which allows the visitors to easily share them across the social networks. These feauters are not included in madPix lightbox. </p>
  <h2><a href="http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/">Swipebox</a></h2>
  <p>Some of the feuters this lightbox uses which are not included in madPix lighbox are some of the following.<br>
    It uses swipe gestures for mobile, keyboard navigation and can be used for videos.</p>
  <h2><a href="http://imageflow.finnrudolph.de/">imageFlow</a></h2>
  <p>Is sort of a slideshow, images can be switched using a drag menu and it also tells which image you are viewing, <br>
    it also can be navigated through scrolling the mouse. Simple, beautiful yet advanced. </p>
  <h2><a href="http://fancybox.net/">fancyBox</a></h2>
  <p>Very similar to madPix lightbox, but fancyBox has a close button on each image which makes it easier for the viewer to know<br> 
    how to close the image and the images can be navigated through scrolling with the mouse. </p>
